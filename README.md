Your task, if you choose to take it, is to write the functionality for the following:

- Listing all to-dos using $firebaseArray
- Adding a to-do to the list.
- Editing a to-do using $firebaseObject
- Removing a to-do

Key Info:

- Firebase is already connected to my collection, so don't worry about that. However, you can use your own data if you want.
- The data is stored in a collection called "todos". Your refs will need to be pointed there.
- If you are using Rob's Firebase, please be kind and leave some data in there for users to test with. Basically, try and leave at least 3 items in there :)
